# maclamp
MacLamp is a simple color changing application for Kuando BusyLight. Uses [libbl](https://github.com/brporter/libbl), my C library for interfacing with the BusyLight.

## What is this?
The [Kuando BusyLight](http://www.busylight.com) is a really great little tool; it's a USB light that ships with software that reflects your Lync / Skype for Business status into The Real World(tm). Unfortunately, integration with Lync or Skype doesn't exist on macOS, and the software that they ship that allows you to manually set the lamp color under macOS doesn't appear to work these days. Because of this, and because I work from home and use my Kuando BusyLight to communicate my status to my family members, I wrote this tiny utility.

## Things To Know
This utility doesn't reflect your Lync or Skype status on macOS - it just lets you set the color of an attached Kuando BusyLight. Reflecting Lync status is coming.
